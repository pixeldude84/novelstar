## What is NovelStar?

NovelStar is a retro-styled, Windows 95-inspired desktop novel writing application built as a single portable HTML file. It brings professional manuscript formatting, scene/chapter organisation, word count tracking, and full-manuscript PDF export into a clean, distraction-friendly writing environment — no subscription, no cloud, no account required.

It runs entirely in your browser as a standalone `.html` file

- **New Project wizard** — configure author name, book title, chapter count, scenes per chapter, and target word count with instant per-scene/per-chapter target preview
- **Iframe-based rich text editor** — uses browser-native contenteditable inside an isolated iframe, enabling native OS spell-check underlines without interference from parent page styling
- **Grammar/spelling hint bar** — real-time detection of doubled words, missing punctuation spacing, lowercase `i`, and common misspellings; displays inline as tagged pills
- **Full-screen writing mode** — immersive black-background mode with live scene/total/target word counters and ESC-to-exit
- **Rich text toolbar** — Bold, Italic, Underline, Left/Centre/Right alignment, font size (14–24pt), Tab insert

- **Stats tab** — total words, target, remaining, progress percentage, progress bar, and per-chapter word count breakdown with over-target highlighting in red
- **Save / Save As** — uses File System Access API where available, with fallback to classic download for all browsers; saves as `.ns` (JSON)
- **Open file** — load any `.ns` project file
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Ctrl+S (Save), Ctrl+Shift+S (Save As), Ctrl+N (New Project), Ctrl+O (Open)
- **Shunn Manuscript Format compiler** — industry-standard manuscript formatting used by literary agents worldwide
- **Print Preview** — paginated white-page preview rendered inline before export
- **PDF export** — generates a correctly formatted submission manuscript via jsPDF: title page with optional address/email/phone, Surname/ShortTitle/Page running header, approximate word count (nearest 100), 12pt double-spaced Courier body, half-inch first-line indent, centred chapter headings one-third down the page, `* * *` scene breaks
- **Scene rename** — double-click in tree or use toolbar button
- **Unsaved changes indicator** — red `● UNSAVED` in status bar
- **Toast notifications** — non-blocking messages for save, load, and error events
- **Custom typewriter SVG icon** — clipart-style typewriter replaces original star symbol in title bar and splash screen
- **Splash screen** — typewriter graphic, New Project / Open File entry points
- **Electron desktop wrapper** — packages the HTML as a native `.exe` / `.dmg` / `.AppImage`
- **GitHub Actions CI** — automated cross-platform build workflow (Windows, macOS, Linux) in a single push

#### Technical Details
- Zero runtime dependencies in the HTML file itself (jsPDF loaded from cdnjs CDN)
- Project data stored as human-readable JSON with `.ns` extension
- Iframe editor isolates contenteditable from `user-select: none` parent — resolves Chromium spellcheck suppression bug
- `toHTML()` / `toText()` use `<div>` per-line structure (not `<br>`) for correct browser editing behaviour
- Word count forced-flush on compile open and PDF/preview generation to prevent stale 0-word counts
- All word count reads go through `getEditorText()` helper which reads live from iframe body
- `electron-builder` configured for portable EXE (Windows), universal DMG (macOS x64 + arm64), and AppImage (Linux x64)

---

## Known Limitations

- **Safari** has limited File System Access API support — Save As will fall back to a file download instead of in-place overwrite.
- The app does **not auto-save** — use Ctrl+S regularly.
- PDF export uses Courier throughout. Shunn format mandates this; font choice is not customisable in v1.0.
- Spellcheck works best in Chrome and Edge. Firefox may not show squiggles in all cases.
