### 🗂️ Scene Tree

- Drag and drop scenes between chapters — drop onto a scene to insert, or onto a chapter header to append
- Add and delete chapters with **+ Chapter** / **Del Ch** buttons; double-click any chapter to rename it
- Drag entire chapter folders to reorder them, with a live blue-line insertion indicator
- Scenes **auto-renumber** (Scene 1, 2, 3…) across all chapters when moved — custom names are preserved

### 🗃️ Story Planner

- Full-screen planner overlay — open via the **⎃ Planner** button in the editor toolbar
- **Wall View** (default) — corkboard-style grid, light gray background, dark-gray chapter headers; the active chapter highlighted in blue
- **Timeline View** — horizontal scroll, one chapter column per chapter, compact cards
- Drag scenes freely between any chapter in either view — changes sync live to the Scene Tree
- Double-click any chapter header to rename it directly in the planner

### 📋 Right Panel

- **Notes** — single focused notes box per scene
- **Characters** — add, describe, and delete story characters
- **Locations** — add, describe, and delete named locations
- Word count stats remain always visible in the status bar

## 🆕 What's New in 1.4

- **Linux desktop app** — native `.deb` package for Ubuntu and Lubuntu; shows in the Applications menu, fully offline, no browser required
- **UI completely redesigned** — modern light mode replaces the Windows 95 aesthetic; cleaner panels, rounded corners, and a refined indigo accent color throughout
- **New typefaces** — `Inter` for UI, `JetBrains Mono` for counters, `Libre Baskerville` for the writing editor
- **Editor margins fixed** — text no longer runs to the edge of the page; the editor now renders as a white page card with proper manuscript-style margins floating on a desk surface
- **Larger editor canvas** — more vertical and horizontal writing space
- **EPUB export fixed** — corrupt ZIP/EPUB output resolved; files now open correctly in Calibre, Apple Books, Kindle, and all major readers
- **Dark mode toggle always visible** — the button is now a bright light-gray circle in dark mode so it's always findable; icon switches between 🌙 and ☀️
- **+ button clipping fixed** — Characters and Locations add buttons no longer get cut off at the panel edge
- **"Open Project…"** replaces "Open File…" on the splash screen
- **Planner rethemed** — light gray background, dark-gray chapter headers, active chapter highlighted in blue; Wall/Timeline toggle buttons now clearly show the active view

See the full [release notes](NovelStar_1_4_ReleaseNotes.md) for details.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Safari / Firefox:** Limited file-system access (Save As → download fallback)
- **PDF:** Uses Times New Roman per Shunn standard
- **Auto-save:** Requires a previously saved `.ns` file — use Save As on new projects first
- **Linux:** On first launch, NovelStar compiles a native GTK launcher (~5 seconds). If GTK/WebKit libraries are not installed, the app opens in your default browser instead — all features work either way.
